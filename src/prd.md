## Thought Process for Feature Selection

**Core Problem Analysis**: Administrative users need tools to manage critical business data (benchmark pricing) and generate accurate quotes for logistics services. The system must provide transparency in operations and confidence in data integrity.

**User Context**: Admin users access this system daily for operational monitoring and periodically for data updates. Quote generation may be used frequently for customer inquiries and business development.

**Critical Path**: 
1. Dashboard overview of system status
2. Import benchmark data when updates are available
3. Generate quotes for customer inquiries
4. Monitor system operations and performance

**Key Moments**: 
1. Data validation feedback for imports
2. Quote generation with detailed pricing breakdown
3. Error handling and resolution guidance
4. System status monitoring

**Simplicity Spectrum**: Clean interface that doesn't overwhelm users with unnecessary complexity while providing comprehensive feedback

### Color Strategy
**Color Scheme Type**: Custom palette based on existing application theme
**Primary Color**: `oklch(0.25 0.08 240)` - professional blue for primary actions
**Secondary Colors**: `oklch(0.95 0.005 240)` - light blue for secondary elements
**Accent Color**: `oklch(0.7 0.15 45)` - warm orange for highlights and CTAs
**Status Colors**: 
- Success: Green (`oklch(0.6 0.15 142)`) for valid data
- Warning: Yellow (`oklch(0.7 0.15 65)`) for warnings
- Error: Red (`oklch(0.577 0.245 27.325)`) for validation failures

### Typography System
**Font Pairing Strategy**: Single font family (Inter) with weight variations for hierarchy
**Typographic Hierarchy**: 
- Page title: 30px, bold
- Section headers: 20px, semibold  
- Body text: 14px, regular
- Detail text: 12px, regular
